Forty (The Hollywood craze): The tabloids
Emily:	Did you hear the latest scandal about Elizabeth Taylor?
Karen:	No, what is it?
E:	There's a rumor that she's actually married to two people.
Frank:	Give me a break! Where do you get these things?
E:	From the tabloids. I read it yesterday, when I was in line at the market.
F:	If I were you, I wouldn't believe that sensationalist trash. Those magazines are not exactly the most reliable source.    
K:	Have you seen the previews for her new movie?
F:	Yes. It's nothing to write home about.
E:	But the critics said that it was a real tearjerker.
K:	Well, the movie's coming out next week. I suggest we go see it and judge for ourselves. 
E:	Maybe. I'll get back to you.
