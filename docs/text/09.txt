Nine (Sports): Football
Jose:  Hey Dave, can you take me to the train station?
David: Sure, but I have practice in thirty minutes.
J:     I'm ready. Let's go. So, how is practice going?
D:     Well, it's tough. We have to build endurance to run with the ball, tackle and take hits.
J:     But isn't the most important thing to kick the ball?
D:     We may be talking about two different sports. I play what we call ‘football' here in the United States, not soccer.
J:     Oh!
D:     We don't kick the ball very much. We have to carry it with our hands.
J:     I see.
D:     How about you? Are you playing any sports?
J:     I might try baseball next semester, but I don't know how to play.
D:     There's nothing you can't learn.
J:     I hope you're right. Oh, here we are. Thank you!
D:     You're welcome!
