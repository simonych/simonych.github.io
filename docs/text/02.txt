Two (Family relationship): At a party
Peter: Hello!
Linda: Hi Peter, come on in.
P:     Thanks. Where's everyone else?
L:     My sister and her husband are in the kitchen. Two or three other people are in the kitchen, too.
P:     This is a very nice apartment.
L:     Thanks. My parents own it.
P:     I see. Is this a picture of your parents over here?
L:     Yes, this is my entire family.
P:     Who's who?
L:     Well, these are my parents, Linda and Joseph.
P:     And who's this?
L:     This is my brother Thomas. I also have a sister but she's not in the picture. She's here tonight.
P:     And who's the little girl?
L:     Well, that's me, of course.
P:     Really? You still have the same beautiful smile!
L:     What a sweet thing to say!
P:     Well, that's the kind of guy I am.
