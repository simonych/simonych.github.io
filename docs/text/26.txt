Twenty Six (Traffic): In a traffic jam on the freeway
John:	I hate driving during rush hour.
Sharon:	I know, but we have to be at work at nine o'clock sharp.
R:	And so do a lot of other people. This traffic is bumper to bumper. We're going to be late.
S:	Look, there's an accident ahead. How about getting off the freeway?
J:	Good idea. There might be less traffic on the streets.
S:	Watch out!  You just cut off the car behind you, and you didn't even use your blinker. 
J:	Sorry. I usually don't drive as recklessly as I am today. 
S:	I hope not.
J:	I'm sure we'll go a little faster on the streets. But let me tell you, tomorrow I'll take the train.  
S:	Me too. How about some music?
J:	Sure. I brought more tapes today. They're in the glove compartment.
