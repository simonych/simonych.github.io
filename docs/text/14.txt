Fourteen (Looking for an apartment): Responding to the classified ads
Lady: Hello?
Mark: Hi! Is the apartment you advertised in the paper still available?
L:    Yes.
M:    May I ask a few questions?
L:    Certainly.
M:    How big is the apartment?
L:    It has one bedroom, a living area, a kitchen, and a small den. The den used to be a separate  bedroom, but the former tenant decided to tear the wall down.
M:    Does it get any light?
L:    Oh, yes. The apartment faces south.
M:    How much is the rent?
L:    Nine fifty a month plus one month's rent as a security deposit.
M:    One last question. Why did the last tenant leave?
L:    His company offered him a job in New York. He moved to the east coast last month.
M:    That's where I'm from. I just moved here a week ago.
L:    What a coincidence!
M:    Yes. Can I see the apartment?
L:    Sure. How about tomorrow at four thirty?
M:    That sounds great. See you then.
