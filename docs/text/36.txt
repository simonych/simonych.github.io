Thirty Six (Cultural Events): Thanksgiving
Claudia: Hi, Sandy. How was your thanksgiving?
Sandy:	 Wonderful. We all went to my parents' new house.
C:	 Is that the one near the freeway that was built last year?
S:	 Yes! Anyway, the turkey was all ready when I got there. But my favorite part is always the stuffing and the mashed potatoes. The pumpkin pie was also fantastic, naturally, since it was made by yours truly. We really pigged out.
C:	 Who else was there? 
S:	 My brother Tony. He and his friends were watching the football game.
C:	 Did he finally get his hair cut?
S:	 Yes. I was surprised.
C:	 Well, I went out to eat with my daughter. My oven wasn't working.
S:	 That's too bad.
C:	 Actually, it was quite nice. At least I didn't have to do all the cooking.
S:	 Tell me, did you get your oven fixed?
C:	 No, not yet. It'll be repaired next week.
