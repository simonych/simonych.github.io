Four (Clothing, colors and size): In a department store
Sharon: Oh I love the clothes in this store, but they cost way too much.
Pat:    I know but I need a dress for Robin and Mike's wedding. What do you think of this one?
S:      Now, that is gorgeous, and you look great in blue.
P:      But I like this red one, too.
S:      Well, try both of them on.
P:      Is there a size ten in blue?
S:      Yes, right here. The fitting rooms are around the corner, by the children's department.
S:      I like the blue.
P:      And it's comfortable too. Is it too short, though?
S:      No. You look beautiful, really.
P:      Thanks. Excuse me, how much is this dress?
Clerk:  You're lucky. All women's fashions are on sale today. Let's see... this dress is twenty five percent off.
P:      I'm convinced. I even have shoes to match.
S:      That's reason enough right there.
