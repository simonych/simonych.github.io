Thirty Nine (Cultural diversity in the USA): Heritage
Beth:	Shannon told me you're sending Jessica to an after-school Chinese language program.
Wayne:	Yes, we want to make sure that she has a chance to use Chinese on a daily basis.
B:	I think it's great that you're doing this. There are several languages in my background, but none of them were passed on to me. 
W:	Really? What languages?
B:	Well, my mother's parents were English and German and I think my father's parents were from Mexico.
W:	You're not sure?
B:	No! I asked my dad where his family came from and he said he didn't really know. In fact, I'm not even sure what his last name used to be before his family changed it. I know his father spoke Spanish but he wouldn't teach it to his kids because it might inhibit their English. 
W:	What a shame!
B:	I think so, too. I wish I had learned another language as a child. It's more difficult as an adult.
