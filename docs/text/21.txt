Twenty One (U.S. Federal agencies): At the post office
Clerk:	Next!
Evelyn:	Good morning. I need five airmail stamps, please.
C:	Sure. Anything else?
E:	Yes. I also want a money order for two hundred dollars.
C:	OK. Please fill out these three forms and sign here. 
E:	Fine.
C:	You are sending the money order within the United States, aren't you?
E:	No, it's going to Argentina. 
C:	In that case, you need to fill out this form as well.
E:	Another form?
C:	Yes, sorry. Can I help you with anything else?
E:	Yes, you have passport applications, don't you?
C:	Well, for that you'll have to go stand in that line over there.
E:	You're kidding, aren't you?
C:	No, unfortunately I'm not.
E:	How frustrating!
C:	I know it is. Sorry about that.
