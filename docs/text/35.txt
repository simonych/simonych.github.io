Thirty Five (Bargaining): A yard sale
Jessica: Hello! Take a look around. Everything is in good condition.
Peter:	 How much is this reclining chair?
J:	 It was a hundred, but I'll give it to you for eighty. 
P:	 That's a bit much. Maybe I'll come back this afternoon.
J:	 Well, a lot more people will be stopping by later. By this afternoon I'll probably have sold it.
P:	 What's your lowest price?
J:	 Make me an offer.
P:	 I'll give you fifty.
J:	 No way. I can't go lower then seventy five
P:	 How about sixty-five?
J:	 Fine. You've got yourself a deal. And come back soon. We'll be selling stuff every weekend.
P:	 Yes, maybe I will.
