Eleven (Health): The doctor's office
Patient:      Hi, this is Carlo Pirelli calling. I need to see the doctor immediately.
Receptionist: Is this an emergency?
P:            Yes, I have a terrible stomachache and a fever.
R:            Is this your first time in this office?
P:            No, I'm a regular patient.
R:            Go ahead and come in right away.
P:            Hi, my name is Carlo Pirelli.
R:            Yes. Take a seat right here for a moment.
Nurse:        Hello. Let me take your temperature and blood pressure.
P:            Sure.
N:            Well, your temperature is a little high, but your blood pressure is perfect for your age.
P:            That's good to hear.
N:            The doctor will be right in.
P:            Thanks.
Doctor:       Mister Pirelli, I hear you're in pain.
P:            Yes. I have a stomachache and I feel a little dizzy.
D:            Does it hurt if I press here?
P:            Yes.
D:            Take a deep breath. It doesn't seem to be anything serious. You probably just have the flu. There's a virus going around. Don't worry about it.
P:            So, there's nothing I can do?
D:            Go home, rest and drink lots of fluids. If you don't feel better in a couple of days, come back to see me.
P:            Thanks.
