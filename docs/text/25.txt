Twenty Five (Urban life): In a poor neighborhood 
Roger:	Carol, this is my sister Linda.
Carol:	Nice to meet you. Roger talks about you all the time.
Linda:	He does?
R:	Don't worry. I didn't ruin your reputation.
C:	I understand you live on Electric Avenue.
L:	Yes, that's right.
C:	I used to live there five years ago. I loved going to Sullivan Park. In the summer, people would have picnics there.
L:	Not anymore. Unfortunately, the area is becoming more and more dangerous. 
C:	Really?
L:	Yes, there's a lot of crime now: carjackings, muggings, you name it. Even gangs are moving in.
C:	That's too bad. When I was living there, it was a really nice neighborhood.
L:	Just last week when I was jogging someone broke into my apartment.
C:	Did they take anything?
L:	No, they were probably scared away by a neighbor.
C:	Are you planning to move?
L:	Actually, I was thinking about it.
