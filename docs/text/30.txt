Thirty (Household chores): At the dinner table
Jill:	Wow! That lasagna was delicious. 
Ken:	Thank you. Does anybody want dessert? 
Sandy:	Yeah, ice cream sounds good to me.
J:	No, thanks. I've been gaining too much weight lately.
S:	Oh, now you're making me feel guilty. 
K:	OK. Who's going to wash the dishes?
J:	Not me. I've been cleaning the bathroom every weekend. I even scrubbed the bathtub really well. 
S:	It's not my turn. I've been dusting the furniture for the last three months. Besides, I vacuumed yesterday. 
K:	Well, I just cooked dinner. I'm not going to do the dishes also.
J:	OK, OK. Sandy and I will do them together.
S:	Fine. You wash and I'll dry.
