Eight (Ongoing activities): Running into friends
Camille: Fabiola, Rick… What are you guys doing here?
Fabiola: Camille, what a surprise!
Rick:    Hi. We're going to the mall. How about you?
C:       I'm going to the hardware store. I need to buy some paint, rollers, and brushes.
F:       Why is that?
C:       Well, because I'm renovating my kitchen and my bathroom.
R:       How is it coming along?
C:       So far so good. I'm painting the kitchen tonight.
R:       Is your husband helping you?
C:       Oh, yeah, he likes to work around the house.
F:       That's great. Listen, do you want to help us paint our kitchen and bathroom?
C:       I don't think so. But you are welcome to borrow our equipment.
R:       Thanks, but I can't imagine Fabiola painting the walls.
F:       Look who's talking. You're not so crazy about do-it-yourself projects, either.
R:       Yes, I am. I'm just too busy.
F:       Oh, sure.
