Eighteen (Traveling): Our next vacation
Jane:   Hi, Monica, how are you?
Monica: I'm OK. I'm very busy at work these days.
J:      Me too. I need a break. I can't wait for my next vacation.
M:      I have a week off next month. My husband and I are going to the Caribbean for seven days.
J:      That sounds exciting! I heard they have beautiful beaches over there. Where exactly are you planning to go?
M:      First, we'll fly to Puerto Rico. Then, we'll go to Barbados, Aruba, and Jamaica.  We're also going to take the boat between the islands.
J:      But you won't have time to relax with that itinerary.
M:      Maybe not, but it's going to be an adventure.
J:      Listen, I have to go now. Have a great time!
M:      OK. I'll send you a postcard.
