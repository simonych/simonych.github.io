Seventeen (The holiday season): Planning the holidays
Ingrid: I just finished sending all my Christmas cards. And except for the sweater I want to give my husband, I even have all my gifts.
Bob:    Congratulations. This will be a very lonely holiday season for me.
I:      I thought your brother and his wife were coming to visit you for Hanukkah.
B:      No, I just spoke to them. They're just too busy to travel this year.
I:      Well, if you want to celebrate Christmas with us…
B:      Are you doing the whole spiel?
I:      Of course. Without a Christmas tree, Christmas carols, cookies, and presents under the tree, Christmas just isn't the same for me.
B:      But I don't have any presents to give you.
I:      Well, you still have time to shop until the twenty fifth. I'm just kidding. Presents or no presents, we'd love to have you.
B:      OK. Let's do it. You can count me in.
