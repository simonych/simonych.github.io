Thirty Seven (Services): My car broke down
Mechanic: Good morning! What seems to be the problem?
Emily: 	  Well, my car stopped all of a sudden, and I couldn't get it started again. So, I had it towed here.    
M:	  If you leave it here, I'll try to check it later.
E:	  Is there any way you could work on it right away? I'm late for work as it is.
M:	  Well, if you give me a minute, I'll see what I can do.
E:	  Thanks so much.
M:	  I jump started your car and it's running fine. But you'll need a new battery soon.   
E:	  Not today. I need to get to work.
M:	  Suit yourself. But if you don't get a battery soon, you'll have the same problem again.
