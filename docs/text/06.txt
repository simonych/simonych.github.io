Six (Time): Late for a date
Antonio: Well, finally.
Jean:    Hi, I'm sorry I'm late.
A:       You were supposed to be here at seven. Where were you? I was worried.
J:       I'm sorry, but the bus was twenty minutes late.
A:       I understand, but now we're late for the seven-fifteen show.
J:       Sorry!
A:       That's OK. The next show starts at nine-thirty.
J:       What time is it now?
A:       No watch! No wonder you're always late! It's twenty to eight.
J:       Well, we have almost two hours to kill. How about dinner before the movie? Are you hungry?
A:       Now that you mention it, yes.
J:       How about pizza?
A:       I'd rather have Mexican food.
J:       Fine, my treat.
A:       I like that. You can be late more often.
