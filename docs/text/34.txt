Thirty Four (The media and communications): Fighting over the remote control
Lisa:	Let me flip through the channels. I'm not sure what's on tonight.
Chris:	Why didn't you buy the TV guide?
L:	When I got to the store they had already sold every single copy.
C:	Well, I know the sports channel is going to televise the boxing match live. It'll be broadcast all over the world. 
L:	Let's see what else is on.
C:	Wait! Go back to the news.
L:	No, the news is so depressing.
C:	What are you looking for?
L:	A sitcom or a movie.
C:	Although, sitcoms are OK, I'd rather watch a sport event or music videos on MTV any day. Give me the remote control.
L:	No way.
C:	Fine. While you watch TV all by yourself, I'll go read the sports section of the newspaper.
