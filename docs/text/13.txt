Thirteen (Shopping for food): At the supermarket
Tom:     How about chicken for dinner tonight?
Kathy:   Sounds good. Do you have the shopping list?
T:       No, I don't.
K:       I don't either. It's probably at home on the kitchen counter.
T:       Great! Do you have any idea what we need?
K:       Well, the chicken and something to serve on the side.
T:       How about vegetables and rice?
K:       Fine. I'll get some carrots and a package of rice.
T:       I think we're out of milk. I'll get some.
K:       Oh. And let's get some eggs for tomorrow morning.
T:       You're not supposed to eat so many eggs. It's not good for you.
K:       Look who's talking. With your usual diet of meat and potatoes, you're a real health nut.
Cashier: Your total is twenty three eighty three.
K:       Here you go.
C:       Out of thirty. Six dollars and seventeen cents is your change.
T:       Oh, no!
K:       What?
T:       The chicken!
