Twenty (American culture and television): Lunch break
Fred: Hi, how was your weekend?
John: I planned to go to Vermont, but because of the weather, we decided to stay home.
Mary: Yes, the snow kept me home, too. I watched TV all weekend.
J:    Did you have a chance to watch the documentary about the Amazon jungle?
M:    No, my husband didn't want to. I was really disappointed. We ended up watching a movie instead.
F:    Which movie did you see?
M:    A rerun of a Hitchcock movie.
F:    I love Hitchcock. I can't get enough of his movies. Isn't Psycho great?
J:    You can't convince me to watch a horror movie. I prefer to watch a sitcom or even a soap opera. Besides, I'd rather read.
F:    I hate to break this up, but we have to get back to work.
J:    If duty calls...
