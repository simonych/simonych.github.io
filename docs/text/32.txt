Thirty Two (Politics and Democracy): Discussing politics
Bob:	Have you been following the presidential campaign this year?
Chris:	More or less. I watched the debate last night.
Martha:	Me too. I like the Republican candidate.
B:	Really, he's too conservative for me. I know he has gone up in the polls lately, but I think he lost the debate last night.
C:	I don't think so. As usual, he showed that he's well informed and that he's a terrific speaker.
M:	Besides, he has a lot of experience in Washington, D.C. where he's very well respected. He's a former senator.
B:	Well, I think that the Democrats have a better platform.
C:	I haven't made up my mind yet. I still don't know who to vote for.
