Twelve (Banking): Opening a bank account
Clerk: How can I help you today?
Mario: We need to open a checking account.
C:     Well, there are two options. First, our standard checking account has no minimum balance requirement, but there's a monthly service fee of ten dollars.
Laura: What about the other option?
C:     Our golden checking account has a minimum balance requirement of one thousand dollars, but there's no monthly service fee. Money orders and traveler's checks are free as well.
M:     Which choice would you prefer?
L:     A ten dollar service fee is a lot of money, but I think we should take the standard checking account anyway.
M:     I agree.
C:     Do you want this to be a joint account?
L:     Yes, please.
C:     Please fill out these forms. Also, I need two forms of identification.
M:     Whose name will appear on the checks?
C:     Both of your names.
L:     Can we get two ATM cards with this account?
C:     Certainly.
