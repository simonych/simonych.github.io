Thirty Eight (Music): At a nightclub
Cindy:	What a great band! 
Edward:	Yes. The drummer was great.
C:	I thought the saxophone player was outstanding.
E:	You know, I could've been a great musician myself if I had pursued it more seriously.
Peter:	Really? What instrument did you play?
E:	The piano. I was really into rock and roll.
P:	So, how come you never pursued a career in music?
E:	Well. I was afraid the work wouldn't be steady enough.
C:	What about now?
E:	If I had more time I would pursue it as a hobby.
P:	I think you should.
E:	I would've liked to have been able to keep up with it.
P:	I know what you mean. I wish I had continued playing too.
E:	There's always tomorrow.
