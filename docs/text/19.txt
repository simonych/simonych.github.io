Nineteen (Hobbies): Love the neighbors
Louise: Hello, neighbor. Long time no see. You look great.
John:   Well, I started exercising three times a week.
L:      Good decision. I should take up regular exercise as well.
J:      But you do all this gardening. With a lot of success, by the way. Your roses are beautiful this year.
L:      Thanks. I enjoy working in the garden so much, it doesn't even feel like exercise.
J:      How's your husband? 
L:      Fine. He started redoing the rec-room this weekend. I hope all the hammering didn't bother you.
J:      Oh, not at all. Peter and I went hiking. We weren't even around to feel disturbed.
L:      Lucky you. It sure bothered me. I couldn't get any reading done.
J:      Still into reading mysteries?
L:      You bet.
J:      Well, don't let the bad guys get away!
L:      I won't. See you around.
L:      Bye!
