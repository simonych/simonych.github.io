Seven (Daily activities): The morning jog in New York
Diana:  Steven, good morning.
Steven: Diana! What a surprise!
D:      Do you jog here every morning?
S:      Yes. Well, I try to, anyway. How about you?
D:      I jog every day, but I don't always come here.
S:      Where do you usually go?
D:      I go to Central Park pretty often.
S:      Wow, that's quite far. What time do you get up?
D:      Usually between six and six-fifteen.
S:      That's awfully early for me!
D:      You're not an early riser, are you?
S:      Not exactly. But you obviously are.
D:      Well, to me it's worth it to go jogging in Central Park. It's so peaceful.
S:      So, would you like to join me for a cup of coffee? I know this cozy little coffee shop on the corner of Bleecker and MacDougal.
D:      That sounds nice.
S:      Great! See you there in thirty minutes?
D:      OK! See you there!
