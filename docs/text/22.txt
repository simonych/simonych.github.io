Twenty Two (Education): A new school
Principal: You just moved here two weeks ago?
Mother:	   Yes, we're still trying to adjust to our new home.
P:	   We will do what we can to help your son make the transition to his new school. I see he finished fifth grade as an honor student.
M: 	   Yes, we're very proud of him. We're just worried that the curriculum is so different here that he will have trouble catching up. Can you recommend a tutor?
P: 	   Sure.
M:	   We want to help him ourselves, but both my husband and I are working…
P:	   Don't worry, your son may not have any trouble catching up by himself. And if necessary, we will set him up with a tutor. I myself will act as his advisor and watch his progress closely. Let's talk to each other after the first week of classes.
M:	   Thanks.
