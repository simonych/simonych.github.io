Thirty One (Summer in the USA): At a barbecue
David:	John, Mary, you made it. Better late than never. 
John:	Well, the directions you gave me were very confusing.
D:	I apologize.  Come on, taste the hors d'oeuveres over here.
Mary:	Mmm, they're delicious. The person who made them must be a professional.
D:	My wife Jessica prepared them.
J:	Where is she, anyway?
D:	She went to pick up Tommy from summer camp.
J:	Hey, is it the same one that we went to?
D:	Yes. Remember our swimming coach?
J:	Of course. He's the one who taught me how to swim. Have you seen him lately?
D:	He's the director now.
J:	Wow. He's moving up in the world.
M:	Is he the one whose son won the swimming competition last year?
J:	Yeah, that's him.
D:	OK. The food is ready. Here are the delicious ribs that I promised you.
M:	I'm so hungry.
