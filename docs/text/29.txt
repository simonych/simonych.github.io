Twenty Nine (Settling down): At a bachelor party
Tony:	Hey, everybody! I'd like to propose a toast to our friend Jerry! He's getting married tomorrow, and I wanna wish him all the best.
Jerry:	Thanks, guys. I can't believe this is finally happening. I have a great job and soon I'll have an amazing wife. And we've recently bought a house. I think I've just fulfilled my dreams. 
T:	Well, let's hope you don't have a rude awakening.
J:	You're all just jealous.
T:	Well, you're right and we're all happy for you, buddy. Actually, I have something to confess.
J:	What's the matter?
T:	Well, I proposed to Gina. 
J:	And? 
T:	We got engaged yesterday.
J:	Congratulations! Cheers!
