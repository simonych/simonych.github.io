Three (Asking for information): Where are my keys?
Chin:   Mom, where are my blue pants?
Mother: Check in your room.
C:      No, they're not there.
M:      Then look on the ironing board.
C:      OK. Here they are! Mom!
M:      Yes, Chin, what is it now?
C:      Sorry, but I can't find my sneakers.
M:      I'm sure you know where they are. Just think for a minute.
C:      Oh! Now I see them. I guess you're right.
M:      Of course I am. I'm your mother.
C:      Well, then tell me where my car keys are.
M:      How about in your coat pocket?
C:      No!
M:      Maybe they're in your gym bag.
C:      Great! They're here. Thanks, Mom. See you later!
M:      Bye! Someday he's going to lose his head!
