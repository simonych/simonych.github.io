Twenty Three (Ceremonies): At a wedding reception
Elsa:	The bride looked beautiful, didn't she?
Linda:	Yes, and so did the groom. He's so handsome.
Peter:	You think so?
L:	Yes, I do.	
P:	Hmm.
L:	Jealous?
P:	No, I have no reason to be. Soon we'll get married ourselves. I'll look very handsome and you'll be a lovely bride.
E:	Oh, yes. Have you decided on a date for your wedding?
L:	May twenty fifth.
E:	What's the matter, Peter? You're suddenly pale.
P:	May twenty fifth. That's… so soon.
L:	Hey, are you getting cold feet?
P:	No, I just didn't realize it would be so soon.
L:	Neither did I.
Rick:	Hello. This is a joyous occasion. Don't be so serious.
E:	Linda and Peter are getting the jitters about their upcoming wedding.
R:	Well, so did we before ours.
E:	Oh, did we?
R:	Yes. But I'm glad I didn't change my mind.
