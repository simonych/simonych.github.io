D:      I go to Central Park pretty often.
S:      Wow, that's quite far. What time do you get up?
D:      Usually between six and six-fifteen.
S:      That's awfully early for me!
D:      You're not an early riser, are you?
S:      Not exactly. But you obviously are.
D:      Well, to me it's worth it to go jogging in Central Park. It's so peaceful.
S:      So, would you like to join me for a cup of coffee? I know this cozy little coffee shop on the corner of Bleecker and MacDougal.

D:     Well, it's tough. We have to build endurance to run with the ball, tackle and take hits.
J:     But isn't the most important thing to kick the ball?
D:     We may be talking about two different sports. I play what we call ‘football' here in the United States, not soccer.

D:     We don't kick the ball very much. We have to carry it with our hands.

Patient:      Hi, this is Carlo Pirelli calling. I need to see the doctor immediately.
Receptionist: Is this an emergency?
P:            Yes, I have a terrible stomachache and a fever.
R:            Is this your first time in this office?
P:            No, I'm a regular patient.
R:            Go ahead and come in right away.
P:            Hi, my name is Carlo Pirelli.
R:            Yes. Take a seat right here for a moment.
Nurse:        Hello. Let me take your temperature and blood pressure.
P:            Sure.
N:            Well, your temperature is a little high, but your blood pressure is perfect for your age.
P:            That's good to hear.
N:            The doctor will be right in.
P:            Thanks.
Doctor:       Mister Pirelli, I hear you're in pain.
P:            Yes. I have a stomachache and I feel a little dizzy.
D:            Does it hurt if I press here?
P:            Yes.
D:            Take a deep breath. It doesn't seem to be anything serious. You probably just have the flu. There's a virus going around. Don't worry about it.
P:            So, there's nothing I can do?
D:            Go home, rest and drink lots of fluids. If you don't feel better in a couple of days, come back to see me.
P:            Thanks.

Clerk: How can I help you today?
Mario: We need to open a checking account.
C:     Well, there are two options. First, our standard checking account has no minimum balance requirement, but there's a monthly service fee of ten dollars.
Laura: What about the other option?
C:     Our golden checking account has a minimum balance requirement of one thousand dollars, but there's no monthly service fee. Money orders and traveler's checks are free as well.
M:     Which choice would you prefer?
L:     A ten dollar service fee is a lot of money, but I think we should take the standard checking account anyway.
M:     I agree.
C:     Do you want this to be a joint account?
L:     Yes, please.
C:     Please fill out these forms. Also, I need two forms of identification.
M:     Whose name will appear on the checks?
C:     Both of your names.
L:     Can we get two ATM cards with this account?
C:     Certainly.

Tom:     How about chicken for dinner tonight?
Kathy:   Sounds good. Do you have the shopping list?
T:       No, I don't.
K:       I don't either. It's probably at home on the kitchen counter.
T:       Great! Do you have any idea what we need?
K:       Well, the chicken and something to serve on the side.
T:       How about vegetables and rice?
K:       Fine. I'll get some carrots and a package of rice.
T:       I think we're out of milk. I'll get some.
K:       Oh. And let's get some eggs for tomorrow morning.
T:       You're not supposed to eat so many eggs. It's not good for you.
K:       Look who's talking. With your usual diet of meat and potatoes, you're a real health nut.
Cashier: Your total is twenty three eighty three.
K:       Here you go.
C:       Out of thirty. Six dollars and seventeen cents is your change.
T:       Oh, no!
K:       What?
T:       The chicken!

Lady: Hello?
Mark: Hi! Is the apartment you advertised in the paper still available?
L:    Yes.
M:    May I ask a few questions?
L:    Certainly.
M:    How big is the apartment?
L:    It has one bedroom, a living area, a kitchen, and a small den. The den used to be a separate  bedroom, but the former tenant decided to tear the wall down.
M:    Does it get any light?
L:    Oh, yes. The apartment faces south.
M:    How much is the rent?
L:    Nine fifty a month plus one month's rent as a security deposit.
M:    One last question. Why did the last tenant leave?
L:    His company offered him a job in New York. He moved to the east coast last month.
M:    That's where I'm from. I just moved here a week ago.
L:    What a coincidence!
M:    Yes. Can I see the apartment?
L:    Sure. How about tomorrow at four thirty?
M:    That sounds great. See you then.

A:   I'm Ana, the new tenant in apartment six F.
J:   Oh right. Someone told me that we had a new neighbor. I'm Jim.

J:   I'm sorry. I don't know.
A:   Well, thanks anyway.
J:   So, you just moved here?
A:   That's right, from the east coast.
J:   Oh really? I came here from Chicago ten years ago. How do you like the west coast so far?

Director: Please take a seat. We received your resume last week. Your credentials are excellent.         
Susan:    Thank you.        
D:        After you finished school you went to work for an insurance company. What were your duties there?
S:        At first I assisted the vice president of corporate sales. I did most of his legwork for him and took care of all the administrative duties.
D:        I see you were promoted twice.
S:        Yes, currently I'm the regional sales representative.
D:        May I ask why you want to leave your present employer after all this time?
S:        The position you advertised offers me the opportunity to move into a managerial position. I believe this is the right step at this point in my career.
D:        I see. You're a very interesting candidate. I have to discuss your application with my colleagues. We'll get back to you next week. 
S:        Thank you very much.  
D:        You're welcome.

Ingrid: I just finished sending all my Christmas cards. And except for the sweater I want to give my husband, I even have all my gifts.
Bob:    Congratulations. This will be a very lonely holiday season for me.
I:      I thought your brother and his wife were coming to visit you for Hanukkah.
B:      No, I just spoke to them. They're just too busy to travel this year.
I:      Well, if you want to celebrate Christmas with us…
B:      Are you doing the whole spiel?
I:      Of course. Without a Christmas tree, Christmas carols, cookies, and presents under the tree, Christmas just isn't the same for me.
B:      But I don't have any presents to give you.
I:      Well, you still have time to shop until the twenty fifth. I'm just kidding. Presents or no presents, we'd love to have you.
B:      OK. Let's do it. You can count me in.

J:      Me too. I need a break. I can't wait for my next vacation.
M:      I have a week off next month. My husband and I are going to the Caribbean for seven days.
J:      That sounds exciting! I heard they have beautiful beaches over there. Where exactly are you planning to go?
M:      First, we'll fly to Puerto Rico. Then, we'll go to Barbados, Aruba, and Jamaica.  We're also going to take the boat between the islands.
J:      But you won't have time to relax with that itinerary.
M:      Maybe not, but it's going to be an adventure.
J:      Listen, I have to go now. Have a great time!
M:      OK. I'll send you a postcard.

Louise: Hello, neighbor. Long time no see. You look great.
John:   Well, I started exercising three times a week.
L:      Good decision. I should take up regular exercise as well.
J:      But you do all this gardening. With a lot of success, by the way. Your roses are beautiful this year.
L:      Thanks. I enjoy working in the garden so much, it doesn't even feel like exercise.
J:      How's your husband? 
L:      Fine. He started redoing the rec-room this weekend. I hope all the hammering didn't bother you.
J:      Oh, not at all. Peter and I went hiking. We weren't even around to feel disturbed.
L:      Lucky you. It sure bothered me. I couldn't get any reading done.
J:      Still into reading mysteries?
L:      You bet.
J:      Well, don't let the bad guys get away!
L:      I won't. See you around.

Fred: Hi, how was your weekend?
John: I planned to go to Vermont, but because of the weather, we decided to stay home.
Mary: Yes, the snow kept me home, too. I watched TV all weekend.
J:    Did you have a chance to watch the documentary about the Amazon jungle?
M:    No, my husband didn't want to. I was really disappointed. We ended up watching a movie instead.
F:    Which movie did you see?
M:    A rerun of a Hitchcock movie.
F:    I love Hitchcock. I can't get enough of his movies. Isn't Psycho great?
J:    You can't convince me to watch a horror movie. I prefer to watch a sitcom or even a soap opera. Besides, I'd rather read.
F:    I hate to break this up, but we have to get back to work.
J:    If duty calls...
